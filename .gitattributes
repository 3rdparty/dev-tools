# We'll let Git's auto-detection algorithm infer if a file is text. If it is,
# enforce LF line endings regardless of OS or git configurations.

# More about LF vs. CRLF on the link below:

* text=auto eol=lf

# Isolate binary files in case the auto-detection algorithm fails and
# marks them as text files (which could brick them).
